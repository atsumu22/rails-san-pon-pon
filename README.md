# üìö Project Name

SAMPOMPOM is a stamp rally generator to help support local shopping streets (shotengai = ÂïÜÂ∫óË°ó). 
A stamp rally is one of the ways to attract people to the shopping streets. However, organizing a stamp rally event is time consuming for most people. This app works to reduce the amount of time needed to prepare stamp rally events. 

 
All the user needs to do is input the information of the rally they want to host. A QR code is generated with a printing option for participating stores to display.  
 
SAMPOMPOM also works for those who want to experience local life in Japan. 
Participants for the stamp rally can enjoy visiting the local shotengai - collecting the rally stamps via the in-store QR code. Once all the stamps are collected, they can redeem a reward which makes the participants‚Äô local trip a little more sweeter.

This app was inspired by a stamp rally event held in my neighborhood. 

## The Origin of The Idea
The shopping street I used to love visiting has disappeared in the last few years. It was heartbreaking to see these shops turned into new, boring buildings devoid of any character. The old local shopping streets in Japan will likely disappear in the near future.  ‚ÄúI want to help revitalize these shopping streets with Sampompom.‚Äù
